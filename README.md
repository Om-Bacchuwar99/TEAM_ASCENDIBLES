Our main idea is to create a chatbot that acts as legal assistance to Indian citizens to help them understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in the constitution.
The implementation includes the use of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Flask, vector libraries, and the ability to use large language models (LLMs). 
Its key features include a user-friendly interface, integration of legal documents, interactive scenarios, personalized legal guidance and multilingual support. 
The program aims to address issues related to legality, data privacy, multilingual support, user understanding and government cooperation while encouraging expansion. 
Expected effects include strengthening the rule of law, integration, better understanding of legal structures, increased public participation and reduced conflict, all leading to increased awareness and public participation.
